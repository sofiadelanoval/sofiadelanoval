Hi there! 👋 I'm Sofia de la Noval, an aspiring game developer, programmer, and tech & art enthusiast from Mexico. I'm currently taking my last semester as a Data Engineer at Universidad del Caribe 🎓.

I'm super passionate about creating immersive, story-driven games! 🎮 I have experience working with Unreal Engine 5, where I've developed gameplay mechanics using both Blueprints and C++ 💻. I even designed and coded the door mechanics for a room transition system and helped with Unreal's Gameplay Ability System (GAS) ✨. I love combining my programming skills with my creative side. I'm a self-taught illustrator and am currently learning 3D modeling in Maya for a solo game project! 🎨

I also have some cool past projects! At CEMEX, I was a Software Engineer and helped create an AI assistant called "Hey Emma" 🤖. This project actually won first place at a national hackathon! 🏆 I also taught programming to kids using Scratch and Minecraft Education Edition, which was so much fun! 🧑‍💻

When I'm not coding or creating, I'm all about game development, storytelling, and interactive entertainment! 🚀

Let's connect!
